Imperialization converts all eligible, new gear entering your inventory to the Imperial style. You can also set Imperialization to only convert items as you equip them, giving you a little more flexibility for deconstruction yields and selling to players.

Conversions do not happen by default. You must set which styles you want to convert from the options menu.

NOTE: Not all gear is convertible. I assume you must have the Imperial Edition of the game for this addon to work, though I have not been able to test it. If you don't have the Imperial Edition, could you try it out and leave me feedback in the comments please? Thanks!

WARNING: Once converted, items are bound to your account. Once bound, an item cannot be transferred to another player (i.e. you can't sell the item to someone else). However, you can still sell bound items to NPC shopkeepers and merchants.
